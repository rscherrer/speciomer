Here we outline the different tibbles that can be produced for a given simulation, which function to use for each of them as well as their dimensions:

where *T* is the number of time points, *N* is the number of individuals, *L* is the number of loci and *E* is the number of edges. Note that the number of individuals can change from one time point to the next, our usage of a seemingly constant *N* here is only for illustratory purpose.
